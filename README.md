## Installation

To set up my dotfiles on your system, simply run the installation script:

```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B3AHEH/dotfiles/main/osx_install.sh)
```

This command will automatically configure the necessary applications and settings for your environment. Before installing new configurations, the script will back up your existing configuration files to ensure that you can restore them if needed.
